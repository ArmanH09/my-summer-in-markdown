## Most Memorable Experience
Near the end of my summer vacation I went to two carmeets in one day, one in the morning and one in night. I went with my cousin to San Clemente to a carshow where they showed off many super cars, and regular modified cars as well. I also saw some cool cars with designs painted on them. In the night I went to another car meet closer to me and I saw a lot of modified cars that made big power, and where very loud. This was a memorable experience because I got to see people I couldn't see for a month cause I was in Armenia and it my also my first time in a month I got to see some cool cars.
## New Skills Learned
Durring my month in Armenia, I could only speak armenian, so durring the whole month my ability to speak armenian went up and I was speaking the language better durring the end of my stay.
